## The Battle Round

*Replace text on page 204 with:*

Alternating 40k is played in a series of battle rounds. In each battle round, players take turns activating units in their army. The same player always has the first turn to act in each phase - the mission you are playing will tell you which player this is. If a player has fewer units to activate than their opponent, then they may pass until this is no longer true.

If a rule refers to your opponents next turn, it should read as referring to your opponents first turn in the next battle round.

Rules that could normally only be activated once per turn, can now only be activated once per battle round.
