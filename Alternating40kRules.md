## The Battle Round

*Replace text on page 204 with:*

Alternating 40k is played in a series of battle rounds. In each battle round, players take turns performing actions and activating units in their army.

The same player always has the first turn to act in each phase - the mission you are playing will tell you which player this is. This player is considered to have the initiative.

If a player has fewer units to activate than their opponent, then they may pass until this is no longer true.

If a rule refers to "per turn", "this turn", "previous turn", "next turn", "start of the turn", or "end of the turn", replace "turn" with battle round.

### Command Phase

Both players gain **Battleforged CP** simultaneously at the start of the phase and then proceed as normal.

### Fight Phase

Units fight in the same order they normally would if it was the turn of the player with the initiative (meaning the player without the initiative has the first opportunity to fight with units that aren't "fights first" or "fights last").
