# Warhammer 40,000 - Alternating

This project exists to offer an alternative way to play Warhammer 40k, by addressing one of it's biggest shortcomings - the lack of anything to do on your opponents turn.

#### Design goals:

- As much as possible, stick to the 40k core rules

- Keep all existing rules functional.
